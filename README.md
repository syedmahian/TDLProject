# TDLProject

The TDL Project aims to create a Spring Boot To-Do List application. It has the CRUD functionalities for two entities: User and ToDos. The back end is programmed using Java, while the front-end was programmed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. SQL was used as the database running from localhost. Please use the .jar (TDLProject.jar) to run the program from command line. The project should run in your web browser, using the port "localhost:9092".

Unforunately, there was an issue with my github before the deadline and all my files were deleted, as such I had to use an older version of my project for submission. The only issue is that the project is named CarProject. As I was short for time, I did not try to change my project name to avoid further damage to my code.

# Repository details
This git repository holds both the front-end and back-end of my project. The front-end folders are located in src/main/resources/static.

The documentation folder holds all the documentation used in the planning and execution of the project.

This will run all the test files, if there are any issues with testing please try updating your maven project and refershing Spring Tools. This was an issue that was faced throughout the project but it can be fixed by updating the maven project.
